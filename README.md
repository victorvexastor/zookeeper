# The Zookeeper

> A field report on 30 million confusing mammals. Written by Senior Enclosure Coordinator Applebee.

## What is this

A book about humans. Written by someone who isn't one.

Applebee is a Senior Enclosure Coordinator assigned to the Human Sanctuary Project. His task: make them happy and flourishing. He arrives with a clipboard, a zoo welfare framework, and the creeping realisation that nobody has ever applied rigorous enclosure science to *Homo sapiens*.

They should have. The evidence was always there.

## The argument

Modern zoos solved the enclosure problem for every species except the one designing the zoos.

Elephants, gorillas, snow leopards — the science is settled. We know what they need to flourish. We built systems around that knowledge.

For humans? We built systems first, and called the resulting suffering a character flaw.

Applebee's report disagrees.

## Structure

Twenty chapters. Four acts.

```
Act I   (Ch 1–5)   Arrival & Horror
                   Applebee surveys the damage. Can't believe what he's seeing.

Act II  (Ch 6–13)  Investigation
                   Forensic inquiry into each broken system.
                   The "decent impulse that scaled badly" pattern.

Act III (Ch 14–17) The Turn
                   Things that work. Humans who got it right.
                   The sanctuary begins to take shape.

Act IV  (Ch 18–20) The Blueprint
                   Applebee submits his recommendations to Mr. Reggie.
                   The report becomes personal.

## Style

Tufte-style typography. Marginal notes. Sidenotes where the real observations live. Figures with captions that do more work than the prose.

The design system is in `../pipeline/design-system.css`.
