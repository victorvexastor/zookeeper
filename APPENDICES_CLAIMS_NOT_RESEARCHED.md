# Claims Not Backed by Research

*Transparency appendix. To be filled during editorial pass when chapters are locked.*

---

## Purpose

Some claims in these books are plausible, argued from first principles, or drawn from zoo science — but lack direct peer-reviewed citation. This appendix flags them. Honest about limits. Not every argument needs a study; some need a study and don't have one yet.

## Structure (template)

For each chapter, log:
- **Claim** — The assertion made
- **Source** — Peer-reviewed? Zoo science? Anecdote? First principles?
- **Gap** — What would be needed to strengthen it

## Notes

- Zoo science analogues (enrichment changes behaviour, enclosure design matters) are well-established for non-human species. The extension to humans is the argument, not the zoo science itself.
- The language proof provides an indisputable anchor; other domains are argued by analogy.
- DV safety button effectiveness: "100% effective" would need citation. GoodSAM/PulsePoint/Hatzalah evidence exists; DV-specific buttons may need separate sourcing.
