# Project Status Notes
*Where we're at. What needs fixing. What flows between the two books.*

**Last updated:** Reference lists, appendices plan, and About the Authors drafted. Chapter 2 restructured as 2-part (Part 1: The Browse, Part 2: The Stairs). Tia/monkey bar story added in Giles voice. Letter under consideration as epilogue. v6 archived.

## The Two Books

| | THE ZOOKEEPER | APPLEBEES_REPORT |
|---|---|---|
| **Voice** | Giles Ross (pen name). Zoologist, soil mite researcher, UWS Hawkesbury. British, now Leiden, 2 sons. Scientific register. "I am the fish." | Applebee. Fictional enclosure coordinator. Field notes. Jenkins (assistant). Mr. Reggie (boss). Dark humour, bewilderment, tenderness. |
| **Frame** | What would it look if someone designed a habitat for humans the way zoos design for animals? | 30 million humans. No manual. Previous coordinator quit. "Make them happy and FLOURISHING." |
| **Structure** | 20 chapters, 4 parts. Sapiens formula, lens turns back. 8 life areas. | 21 chapters, 4 acts. Arrival → Investigation → Turn → Blueprint. |
| **Location** | `THE_ZOOKEEPER/` | `APPLEBEES_REPORT/` |

## THE ZOOKEEPER — Current State

### Chapter status (from file list)
- **chapter_02_v6.md** — Current. "The Great Myth of Moral Failure." Koala lab, sandwich, cost/marketing point, terpene/immune section, Rothamsted wheat, Kitava/Tsimane. Has opening about guilt trap + "who is protected by such a story?"
- **chapter_03_v4.md** — Current
- **chapters 04–20** — All at v2
- **archive/** — v1, v4, v5 of various chapters

### What THE_ZOOKEEPER_FORMULA says
- Use Harari's weapons. Aim at the right target (animal flourishing, not power).
- Lens turns back. Giles is IN the enclosure.
- Compassion note: every destructive system started as something good.
- Steelman before subverting.
- "Same techniques. Different lens. Different target."

### What THE_ZOOKEEPER_STRUCTURE says Ch2 should cover
- HOOK: Giles at Hawkesbury, eucalyptus labs
- Koala contrast: 49 compounds, then food court
- **Body: food, movement, sleep, substances**
- Barefoot running callback
- CLOSE: animal that poisons its own food supply

### Gap
Ch2 v6 is **food-only**. Movement (treadmill, shoes, barefoot) and sleep (circadian, diurnal mammal) were discussed earlier as needing their own space — possibly separate chapters or a "Vehicle" split. Structure says Ch2 = food + movement + sleep. Current v6 = food only.

## APPLEBEES_REPORT — What Exists

### Strong material that could flow to Zookeeper

**1. The stairs / climbing wall / monkey bar sequence** (Chapter 6: The Vehicle)
- "They evolved to climb through treetops and they built STAIRS."
- Climbing wall would be more efficient — same footprint, engages shoulders/grip/core/vestibular.
- "When did they decide adults don't need what children need?"
- "There are no adult playgrounds." Gyms = stripped movement, no joy, no play.
- **The monkey bar story**: Human built monkey bars in bedroom. Jarrah hardwood, wall to wall. Trapeze outside. Climbing bars under the stairs. Real estate demanded structural engineer. Engineer approved. Then charged $10,000 to remove them. "Ten thousand units. To remove monkey bars. From a PRIMATE'S HOME."

This is YOUR story. It's in Applebee's voice. It needs a Giles version — first person, your home, your rage — for Zookeeper.

**2. Slow poisoning** (Chapter 8)
- Mushroom woman: convicted, horrified. Food system: carcinogens at scale, no conviction.
- "Slow harm is legalised. Fast harm is criminalised."
- PNI: stress → immune suppression → cancer terrain.
- Different framing than Zookeeper's "moral failure" — but the logic (system, not individual) aligns.

**3. Body/Vehicle observations**
- Chair vs squat. "Their buttock muscles literally stop working from disuse."
- Brachiation, bilateral coordination, autistic kids who climb — clinicians try to stop it; climbing therapy improves outcomes.
- Healthcare: $4.3 trillion treating consequences of environmental mismatch.

## What Zookeeper Has That Applebees Doesn't

- **Koala lab scene** — 49 compounds, Dr. Chen, HPLC. Vivid, sourced, zoological proof of concept.
- **Sandwich breakdown** — enzymes, DATEM, iceberg lettuce, Rothamsted wheat.
- **Kitava/Tsimane** — zero acne, insulin decreases with age, clean arteries with chronic inflammation.
- **Uricase / survival switch** — 15 million year mutation, 37-fold sugar increase.
- **"What happened to my browse?"**
- **The Lie section** — moral failure myth, perpetrator is us (collective), we're zookeeper AND exhibit.

Applebee could "discover" the koala facility and the sandwich contrast — he finds research. But the personal Hawkesbury scene is pure Giles.

## Cross-Pollination — Concrete Suggestions

### From Applebees → Zookeeper
1. **Monkey bar story** — Rewrite in Giles voice. "I installed monkey bars in my home. Natural jarrah. Wall to wall. I had to get an engineer to approve them. Then the real estate charged me $10k to remove them. From a primate's home."
2. **Stairs / climbing wall** — What do zoos give running/climbing mammals? Apes get climbing structures. We get stairs. The rage.
3. **"When did adults stop needing what children need?"** — Could fit Giles's Vehicle or Cub chapter.
4. **Mushroom woman vs food system** — The speed/attribution frame. Could sit alongside or after the moral failure section in Ch2.

### From Zookeeper → Applebees
1. **Koala facility** — "I found a facility in Australia that runs pharmaceutical-grade chemistry on a single leaf..."
2. **49 compounds / sandwich** — Applebee's horror at the disparity.
3. **Kitava / Tsimane** — Evidence that the system is the variable.
4. **Cost of marketing vs cost of testing** — Fits Applebee's tone. "Whatever figure you arrive at, double it."

## Things That Definitely Need Fixing / Massaging (Zookeeper)

1. **Ch2 scope** — Structure says food + movement + sleep. v6 is food-only. Either:
   - Expand Ch2 to include movement (treadmill, barefoot, monkey bars?) and sleep, or
   - Split: Ch2 = The Browse (food), Ch3 = The Climbing Gym (movement) — or similar.

2. **Fibre claim** — Was removed (Inuit had zero fibre, healthy). Good. Confirm it's gone in v6.

3. **Editorial notes** — v4 had bracketed notes like `[Who is protected by such a lie?]`. v6 has this as prose: "it is worth asking who is protected by such a story." Confirm that's the intended use of the subtext.

4. **Version drift** — Multiple chapter versions (v2, v4, v5, v6). Archive exists. Need a clear "current" for each chapter.

5. **LETTER.md** — The "Letter to Confused Zookeepers" — different tone (direct address to zookeepers). Relationship to main text unclear. Standalone? Epilogue? Appendix?

## The Formula vs The Structure

**THE_ZOOKEEPER_FORMULA** (how to write):
- 120-150 words/paragraph, 7 ideas/100 words
- Use rhetorical questions, "we," defamiliarisation — but for truth, not power
- Steelman. Name sources. Lens turns back.
- More anecdote (25% vs 16%), less setup-subvert (15% vs 23%)

**THE_ZOOKEEPER_STRUCTURE** (what to write):
- Syllogism: 8 needs → systems are misguided attempts → systems scaled past capacity → redesign
- Part 1: The Animal (Ch1-5)
- Part 2: The Enclosure (Ch6-10)
- Part 3: Scale Problem (Ch11-15)
- Part 4: The Sanctuary (Ch16-20)

Formula and structure align. Ch2 in structure = Vehicle = body (food, movement, sleep). Ch2 in current draft = food only. The movement material exists in Applebees. The sleep material existed in Zookeeper v4.

## Author Notes (Sensitive)

**Mushroom case (Applebee Ch8):** The Erin Patterson case — user feels horrible about it, doesn't understand her, doesn't want to appear to sympathise. "Mushrooms" is what they call her; her name is Erin. Erin's harm wasn't fast — it took years. The example still works (everyone feels horrible; it makes you question our choices with other stuff) but user is hesitant. Do not add mushroom content to Zookeeper without explicit direction.

## Open Questions

1. ~~Is Ch2 meant to stay food-only?~~ Resolved: Ch2 is now 2-part (Browse + Stairs/movement)
2. Where does the monkey bar story live? Ch2 (Vehicle)? A dedicated movement chapter?
3. Applebee's stairs rage — Giles version? Same argument, different voice?
4. Relationship between the two books: companion? Same material, two voices? Sequential?
5. BOOK-OVERVIEW in Applebees is just a list of file paths — is there a fuller overview elsewhere?
