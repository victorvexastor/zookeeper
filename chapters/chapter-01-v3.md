# Chapter 1: You Are a Zookeeper

Somewhere in your city there is a person who has not been touched by another human being in over a month. They have a job. They have shelter. They have food in the refrigerator and a screen that connects them, in theory, to every other person on the planet. By every metric their civilisation uses to measure welfare, they are fine. They are not fine. A zoologist would recognise this instantly — would flag the isolation, the stereotypic behaviour, the flat affect, the way the organism returns each evening to the same small space and sits in the same position and stares at the same luminous rectangle until consciousness ceases. In any other species, this would be called a welfare emergency. In Homo sapiens, it is called Tuesday.

Every modern zoo has solved a problem that no human civilisation in history has managed to solve. The problem is this: how do you take a complex social animal, place it in an artificial environment, and make it flourish? Not merely survive — not simply keep it fed, sheltered, and breathing — but create conditions under which it is curious, socially engaged, physically healthy, and psychologically whole. The zoological profession has been refining this answer for half a century. It has a science, a literature, and a set of measurable standards. For elephants, the answer is known. For snow leopards, the answer is known. For the western lowland gorilla, the answer is known. For Homo sapiens, the answer is apparently not. Despite the overwhelming amount of literature containing it.

This book is an attempt to provide any average person with it.

The idea came to me in the penguin house at Rotterdam Zoo, which is an odd place for a revelation but not, perhaps, an inappropriate one. I had spent twelve years studying Acari — soil mites — in the Antarctic, a discipline that teaches you two things of lasting value: patience, and the conviction that even the smallest organism operates within systems of staggering complexity. A soil mite in the McMurdo Dry Valleys is embedded in a web of temperature gradients, moisture cycles, microbial communities, and geological forces stretching back millions of years. Remove any single variable? The organism fails. The mite does not know this. It simply lives, or doesn't, depending on whether the system holds.

Standing in that penguin house, watching a colony of seventy-three Humboldt penguins navigate a habitat designed by people who had spent decades studying their species' needs — water temperature, colony density, nesting substrate, light cycles, social dynamics — I had a thought that would not leave me alone. The thought? Strange as it may sounds, what would it look like if someone did this for me?

Not in the way architects do it, designing buildings for aesthetic or commercial purposes. Not in the way urban planners do it, optimising traffic flow and population density. Not in the way governments do it, managing economies and legal systems. But in the way these people had done. For the SPECIES NAME. The way basically any high level zooologist does. Starting from the animal. Starting from the question: what does this specific organism, with its specific evolutionary history, its specific neurology, its specific social structure, actually need in order to flourish? Designing a habitat to match it. Not the other way around. 

The question sounds patronising. Our discomfort is precisely the point. It exposes us to an assumption so deeply embedded in modern thought that most of us never examine it: the assumption that human civilisation, whatever its flaws, represents the best available environment. That our cities, our economies, our institutions — however imperfect — are broadly calibrated to us. That the systems we have built are, in some fundamental sense, designed for us.

They are not. By the way. And stranger still, all of science is in agreement on it.

## The Enclosure Problem

In 1965, the typical zoo enclosure was a concrete pen with iron bars. It was designed around the keeper's convenience — easy to clean, easy to observe from, easy to control. Carl Hagenbeck's revolutionary open-air Tierpark in Hamburg, built in 1907, had demonstrated decades earlier that enclosures could be designed around the animal rather than the keeper, using moats instead of bars and naturalistic landscapes instead of concrete. But Hagenbeck's insight was treated as an architectural novelty rather than a welfare imperative, and for most of the twentieth century the default remained: the cage serves the institution, not the inhabitant. The animal was visible, contained, and miserable. Stereotypic behaviour was endemic — the repetitive pacing of big cats, the swaying of elephants, the self-harm of isolated primates. These behaviours were understood, when they were understood at all, as inevitable features of captivity. Some animals, it was believed, simply could not adapt to confined spaces. The fault lay with the creature, not the cage.

The revolution in zoo science over the following decades dismantled this assumption entirely. The work of Heini Hediger at Zürich Zoo in the 1950s had already established that animals in captivity are not *"wild animals in cages"* but organisms responding to a set of environmental pressures. Hediger demonstrated that flight distance, territorial behaviour, and social structure could be accommodated within artificial environments. It simply meant designing **the environment around the animal's biology**. Prior to this, the assumption was that the animals 'nature' was the problem. Hediger insisted, it was the enclosure. Hediger was correct.

By the 1990s, the zoological profession had codified Hediger's insight into formal welfare frameworks. The most influential was the "Five Freedoms," originally developed by the UK's Farm Animal Welfare Council in 1979 and subsequently adopted across the zoo world: freedom from hunger and thirst, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain, injury, and disease, freedom to express normal behaviour, and freedom from fear and distress. These five negative freedoms — freedoms from suffering — represented a minimum standard. They asked: is the animal not in pain? Is it not frightened? Is it not starving?

The limitations of this framework became apparent quickly. An animal can satisfy all five freedoms and still be profoundly unfulfilled. A gorilla with adequate food, appropriate temperature, no injuries, space to move, and no predators can nonetheless exhibit all the hallmarks of psychological collapse: lethargy, social withdrawal, loss of appetite, repetitive behaviours. The absence of suffering is not the presence of flourishing. Removing what is *bad* does not automatically produce what is ***good***. This distinction, obvious once stated, took the profession decades to operationalise.

David Mellor's "Five Domains" model, introduced in 1994 and refined over the following twenty years at Massey University in New Zealand, attempted to address this gap. Mellor replaced the negative freedoms with a framework that included positive experiences: nutrition, environment, health, and behavioural interactions, all feeding into a fifth domain of mental state. The innovation was the explicit recognition that animal welfare is not merely the absence of harm but the presence of positive affective states — curiosity, social bonding, play, agency, and what Mellor carefully termed "comfort." The animal should not merely be free from suffering. *It must have opportunities for satisfaction.*

This was progress. But even the Five Domains, sophisticated as they are, were built for animals whose needs can be described in physical, social, and behavioural terms. A well-designed gorilla enclosure provides complex vegetation, opportunities for foraging, appropriate social groupings, and environmental variability. The gorilla does not require an explanation for why it exists. It does not need a narrative framework within which its daily activities acquire significance. It does not lie awake at night wondering whether its contributions to the troop have lasting value.

Homo sapiens does all of these things. And this is where every existing welfare framework breaks down.

## The Peculiar Ape

Consider the species from first principles, as though encountering it for the first time in a field survey.

Homo sapiens is a bipedal omnivore of the order Primates, family Hominidae. Average body mass ranges from 50 to 90 kilograms across populations, with significant sexual dimorphism. The species is an endurance specialist — the physiological structure of its legs, its capacity for evaporative cooling through eccrine sweat glands, and its relatively efficient gait allow it to outperform most quadrupeds over distances exceeding 20 kilometres. In Daniel Lieberman's phrase, the human is a "born runner" — a persistence predator whose ancestral hunting strategy relied not on speed but on sustained pursuit until prey collapsed from heat exhaustion.

The feet deserve particular attention, because they illustrate a principle that will recur throughout this book. The human foot is not merely a locomotion platform — it is a sensory organ. Each sole contains approximately 200,000 nerve endings across four distinct classes of mechanoreceptor, making it one of the most information-dense surfaces on the body. These receptors continuously relay data about ground texture, slope, temperature, and pressure to the central nervous system, enabling the micro-adjustments in gait and balance that allow bipedal locomotion over uneven terrain. Lieberman's own 2010 study in *Nature* demonstrated that humans running barefoot naturally adopt a forefoot strike pattern that generates significantly less collision force than the heel-strike induced by modern running shoes — shoes that were, it is worth noting, not invented until the 1970s. For the roughly two million years prior, the species ran either barefoot or in minimal coverings. The foot evolved as a direct interface between the organism and its environment: a sensory conversation between animal and ground, conducted through 200,000 nerve endings, across every terrain the planet offers. The modern shoe — padded, elevated, rigid — does not enhance this conversation. It silences it. We will return to this in Chapter 2, because the pattern it represents — a well-intentioned intervention that severs the animal from its own biology — turns out to be the defining feature of the human enclosure.

The most distinctive anatomical feature is the brain: approximately 1,400 cubic centimetres, roughly three times the size predicted by body mass for a primate of its dimensions. This organ constitutes about 2% of total body weight but consumes approximately 20% of the organism's metabolic energy at rest — an allocation without parallel in the mammalian world. By comparison, a typical mammal allocates 5-8% of resting metabolism to neural tissue. The sapiens brain is, by any metabolic standard, extraordinarily expensive to operate.

This expense has cascading consequences. The most significant is obstetric: the human infant must be delivered at a remarkably early stage of neural development, because the skull cannot pass through the birth canal if the brain develops any further in utero. A chimpanzee neonate is born with a brain approximately 40% of its adult size. A human neonate arrives at roughly 25%. The result is the most helpless infant of any primate species — unable to cling, unable to support its own head, unable to locomote for approximately twelve months. Robert Martin at the Field Museum in Chicago has described human infants as "exterogestate foetuses" — organisms that are, by any reasonable biological standard, still in development at the point of birth. Other lineages have solved this problem differently: marsupials deliver tiny, embryonic young — a kangaroo joey is born at roughly two centimetres and less than a gram — and complete development in the pouch; monotremes bypass live birth entirely, laying eggs like the reptilian ancestors from which all mammals descend. The human solution is unique among placental mammals and arguably the most demanding of any: no pouch, no egg, just years of total dependence on caregivers. The species solved the problem of the oversized brain by outsourcing development to the community. It takes a village, as the saying goes — but the saying understates the case. It takes a village, continuously, for a quarter of a century.

The dependency period that follows is without precedent among mammals. Full neural maturation in Homo sapiens is not achieved until the mid-twenties — a quarter-century of development requiring continuous resource investment from caregivers. No other species on the planet demands anything comparable. A wildebeest calf can run with the herd within hours of birth. A human being cannot reliably feed itself for years.

The evolutionary logic is straightforward: the brain must be worth it. Whatever this organ produces must generate sufficient survival advantage to justify two decades of vulnerability and the enormous caloric burden of running it. The standard explanation — that the sapiens brain enables tool use, language, and social cooperation — is correct but incomplete. Crows use tools. Dolphins have language. Ants cooperate on scales that dwarf any human city. The sapiens brain does something qualitatively different from all of these, something that no other nervous system on earth appears to do.

Generates fictions.

Not in the pejorative sense. In the functional sense. The sapiens brain constructs detailed models of situations that do not exist — scenarios that have never occurred, environments that have never been encountered, social arrangements that have never been tested — and then evaluates them, manipulates them, and acts on them as though they were real. Michael Tomasello at the Max Planck Institute has spent decades demonstrating that this capacity for "shared intentionality" — the ability to jointly imagine a hypothetical scenario and coordinate behaviour around it — is the cognitive feature that separates sapiens from every other great ape. A chimpanzee can plan. A human can plan together, about things that aren't there.

This is the engine of everything that follows: language, religion, law, money, science, nations, corporations, human rights. Every one of these is, at its foundation, a collectively maintained fiction — a shared model of reality that coordinates behaviour across groups far larger than any individual could manage through direct social bonds. Robin Dunbar's research at Oxford suggests that a human brain can maintain approximately 150 stable social relationships through direct personal knowledge. Everything beyond that number — every institution, every currency, every legal system, every religion — is maintained not by personal trust but by shared fiction.

The implications for enclosure design are profound. This is not merely a social primate that requires companions. This is a fiction-generating primate that requires narratives, frameworks, symbols, and meaning-structures as fundamental environmental inputs — as basic as food and shelter.

## The Violence Anomaly

One more feature of the species requires attention before any enclosure framework can be developed, because it is the feature that makes the task most urgent.

Homo sapiens is violent. This statement requires immediate qualification, because violence is common across the animal kingdom and the claim being made here is not that humans are uniquely aggressive. Chimpanzees conduct lethal raids on neighbouring groups. Meerkats have one of the highest rates of intraspecific killing among mammals. Langur monkeys practise infanticide as a reproductive strategy. Violence, in zoological terms, is unremarkable.

What is remarkable about human violence is its relationship to intention and scale. Richard Wrangham at Harvard has documented what he terms "proactive aggression" — violence that is planned, deliberate, and executed outside the immediate context of threat or competition. Most animal violence is reactive: a territorial incursion provokes a defensive response; a rival's presence triggers aggression; a threat to offspring generates protective attack. The violence is proportional, contextual, and self-limiting. It stops when the trigger is removed.

Human proactive aggression operates differently. It is premeditated, organised, and frequently executed against individuals who pose no immediate threat. It can be sustained across years, directed at targets never personally encountered, and justified through precisely the kind of shared fictions described above. A chimpanzee cannot wage war against a group it has never seen, for a cause it imagined, using tools it designed specifically for the purpose. A human can and regularly does.

The scale is also without parallel. Matthew White's tabulations in *The Great Big Book of Horrible Things* estimate that organised human violence — war, genocide, political repression, and state-sanctioned killing — has produced approximately 400 million deaths in the last thousand years alone. No other species comes close. Not because other species lack aggression, but because no other species possesses the cognitive infrastructure to coordinate violence across vast populations of strangers.

This might suggest that the fiction-generating brain is the problem — that the very organ enabling cooperation at scale also enables destruction at scale. There is truth in this, but it is not the whole truth. The more precise observation, and the one that matters for enclosure design, comes from the zoological literature itself.

Frans de Waal at Emory University has spent four decades documenting what he calls the "dual nature" of primate sociality. Every primate species capable of significant aggression is also capable of significant reconciliation. Chimpanzees that fight also reconcile, through grooming, food sharing, and physical contact. The capacity for violence and the capacity for peace are not opposing forces — they are two outputs of the same social system. The question is not whether an animal is aggressive. The question is what environmental conditions favour one output over the other.

Every competent zookeeper knows this obvious **fact**. Aggression in captive animals is a diagnostic signal. It tells you the enclosure is failing — that space is too limited, resources too scarce, social structures too disrupted, or enrichment too sparse. The response is never to punish the aggressive animal. The response is to fix the environment. This is not ideology. It is protocol. It is the professional standard that governs the management of every species in every accredited zoo on the planet.

Except one.

When Homo sapiens exhibits aggression — and it does so at rates that would trigger immediate welfare investigations in any other captive population — the dominant institutional response in most human societies is punishment. A response unacceptable in zoology for obvious reasons. And unnacceptable in society if we actually think about it. In society, the aggressive individual is isolated, confined, deprived of social contact, and then returned to the same environment that produced the aggression. The environmental conditions are not examined. The enclosure is not redesigned. The diagnosis is located in the individual rather than the system.

This would be considered illegal in any zoo. Malpractice. In human civilisation, it is considered justice.

In 2010, a sixteen-year-old boy named Kalief Browder was arrested in the Bronx for allegedly stealing a backpack. He could not afford bail — three thousand dollars. He was sent to Rikers Island to await trial. The trial never came. He spent three years in the facility, more than two of them in solitary confinement — a concrete cell, twenty-three hours a day, no physical contact with another human being. He was beaten by guards and by other inmates. He attempted suicide multiple times while incarcerated. When he was finally released — without conviction, the charges simply dropped — he was twenty years old and had spent his entire adolescence in conditions that would be illegal for a laboratory rat. Two years later, at the age of twenty-two, Kalief Browder hanged himself from an air conditioning unit in his family home.

The zoological assessment is straightforward. A juvenile social mammal was removed from its group, placed in isolation, subjected to chronic physical stress, deprived of environmental enrichment, social contact, and agency for a period exceeding one thousand days, and then returned to an environment in which none of the conditions that produced the original behaviour had been modified. The outcome was predictable. It is the outcome any competent animal behaviourist would expect. It would not be permitted in a research laboratory, where ethics committees enforce minimum standards of care for rodents. For a sixteen-year-old primate of the genus Homo — accused, never convicted, of taking a bag — it was considered procedurally unremarkable.

## Eight Things

If the Five Freedoms are insufficient and the Five Domains are incomplete, what framework could possibly capture the environmental requirements of a species this complex?

The question occupied me for the better part of a year. I researched widely — Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Seligman's PERMA model of wellbeing, Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory, Max-Neef's fundamental human needs taxonomy, the WHO's dimensions of wellbeing. Each framework captured something real. None captured everything. And all of them shared a peculiar limitation: they were designed by humans, for humans, within the conceptual categories of human culture. None of them started from the animal.

Starting from the animal means asking the question the way a zookeeper would ask it: not "what do humans say they need?" but "what does the organism require, given its evolutionary history, its neurology, and its behavioural repertoire, in order to exhibit the full range of species-typical flourishing behaviours?"

The distinction matters. If you ask a gorilla what it needs — setting aside the communication problem — you might get answers framed by its current environment. A gorilla in a barren enclosure might "want" more food, because food is the only enrichment available. A gorilla in a well-designed habitat would never prioritise food above social interaction, because its needs are being met in proportion. The animal's stated preferences are shaped by its environment. The animal's actual needs are shaped by its biology.

The same is true of humans, and this is the source of a great deal of confusion. A human living in a system that provides abundant material goods but insufficient social connection will report that material goods are important and social connection is a luxury. A human living in a system that provides social connection but insufficient autonomy will report that belonging is enough and freedom is dangerous. The fish, as David Foster Wallace observed, does not know it is in water. Wallace told this parable — two young fish swimming along, and an older fish passes and says "Morning, boys. How's the water?" and one young fish turns to the other and asks "What the hell is water?" — in a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, three years before he took his own life. He was talking about the default settings of adult existence: the way the most obvious, pervasive realities are the hardest to see. The water, for Homo sapiens, is the assumption that the enclosure is natural. That commuting two hours a day is transport, not a welfare failure. That seeing a doctor for eleven minutes once a year is healthcare. That spending the first eighteen years of life in fluorescent-lit rooms arranged in rows is education. That the vague, persistent sense that something is not quite right — the Sunday evening dread, the nameless Wednesday exhaustion, the way the organism keeps asking *is this it?* — is a personal failing rather than a diagnostic signal. The water is the enclosure. And the enclosure is invisible precisely because it is everything.

Before I describe the framework, consider the animal it was designed for. Not a hypothetical animal — the statistically median one. She is thirty-four years old. She sleeps six hours and twelve minutes per night, approximately ninety minutes less than her neurology requires. She commutes fifty-two minutes each way to a job that uses perhaps three of the skills she spent four years at university developing, and she spends ten hours of each day either at this job or travelling to and from it. She eats two of her three daily meals alone, one of them at her desk. She exercises less than the WHO minimum. She has not made anything with her hands in months. She has four hundred online connections and two people she could call at three in the morning. She is in debt. She is on a waiting list for a therapist. She has not been asked what she is good at since a school careers adviser put the question to her at seventeen, and she did not know the answer then either. She would describe herself, if asked, as "fine — just tired." A zoologist would not describe her as fine. A zoologist would describe her as a social mammal in chronic environmental deficit across every measurable dimension of species-typical functioning. The zookeeper's term for this is "not flourishing." The human term for this is "normal."

Working from zoological first principles — from the species file rather than the cultural survey — eight distinct categories of environmental requirement emerge. I call them "life areas" rather than "needs" because the word "need" implies deficiency, and the framework is designed to describe flourishing, not merely survival. They are:

**The Vehicle.** The body. Food, movement, sleep, substances, physical health. Every animal requires appropriate nutrition, space for species-typical locomotion, adequate rest, and an environment that supports rather than undermines its physiological systems. For a soil mite, this means temperature range and moisture availability. For Homo sapiens, it means an extraordinary range of inputs: varied nutrition calibrated to an omnivore's digestive system, opportunities for the sustained aerobic movement the species evolved to perform, sleep environments compatible with circadian biology, and an absence of chronic physiological stressors.

**The Cub.** Play and rest. Not rest as recovery — that belongs to the Vehicle. Rest as purposeless presence. Play as activity without productive function. Ethologists have long recognised play behaviour as a reliable indicator of welfare in captive animals. Stuart Brown at the National Institute for Play has documented that play deprivation in social mammals produces effects remarkably similar to sleep deprivation: cognitive decline, social dysfunction, increased aggression, and reduced problem-solving capacity. A well-fed animal that never plays is not flourishing. It is surviving.

**The Herd Member.** Connection. Relationships, community, belonging, intimacy. Homo sapiens is an obligately social species — prolonged isolation produces measurable neurological damage, as documented by John Cacioppo at the University of Chicago in his studies on the physiology of loneliness. The species requires not merely the presence of conspecifics but relationships of sufficient depth and stability to satisfy its bonding neurology: the oxytocin system, the endogenous opioid system, the mirror neuron network.

**The God.** Creativity. Making, expressing, building, imagining, shaping reality. The fiction-generating brain does not merely require fictions for social coordination — it requires the active process of creating them. Ellen Dissanayake's work at the University of Washington on "artification" — the human compulsion to make things special, to pattern and ornament and transform — suggests that creative behaviour is not a cultural luxury but a biological drive, as fundamental to the species as grooming is to other primates.

**The Slave.** Service. Contributing, protecting, giving, supporting. The word is deliberately uncomfortable. In zoological terms, service behaviour — protecting the young, provisioning the group, maintaining the territory — is among the most fundamental pro-social drives in cooperative species. It is not self-sacrifice in the moral sense. It is the mechanism by which social animals maintain the group structures on which their individual survival depends. Remove the opportunity for service from a social mammal and you get listlessness, withdrawal, and the erosion of social bonds — precisely the symptoms observed in retired humans and isolated elderly populations. Consider that the best-selling video game franchise in human history is called *Call of Duty*. Not Call of Pleasure, not Call of Profit — Call of Duty. The name is not accidental. It speaks to something the males of the species, in particular, recognise at a visceral level: the drive to protect, to serve a unit, to be needed by something larger than oneself. When the real enclosure offers no outlet for this drive — no squad, no mission, no meaningful contribution — the animal will find a simulation that does. And it will play it, with extraordinary commitment, every night. The objection arises immediately: what about *Grand Theft Auto*? What service drive is satisfied by stealing cars, evading police, and — the example people inevitably reach for — killing prostitutes? The prostitute example deserves attention rather than dismissal. In the game, a player can pay for a service that restores health, then kill the provider to recover the money. Some players do this routinely, throughout the entire game, because it works — it optimises resources for the team, it keeps the crew funded, it improves the group's chances of success. Within the logic of the simulation, there is no consequence and considerable strategic advantage. The player is not practising cruelty. The player is provisioning the unit. The morality is absent because the game has no morality — only systems, and the animal is extraordinarily good at optimising systems.

But this is precisely the point. Watch what the player is actually doing across the session. They are playing cooperatively, online, with their friends. They are protecting each other. Strategising together. Sacrificing in-game resources for their crew. The content is theft and murder; the experience is brotherhood. *Grand Theft Auto* became the best-selling entertainment product in human history — surpassing eight billion dollars — not because of the single-player sandbox, but because of GTA Online: heists with your crew, territory to defend, a business to build together. The antisocial content is the setting. The social cooperative play is what keeps the animal logging in, night after night, for a decade. The animal does not boot up the simulation for the criminality. It boots it up for the squad — which is to say, for actual human beings. The player, their friends, the crew: these are real people, and the animal cares for them. The prostitute in the game is not a person. We can see the animal knows the difference. We always have.

**The Master.** Mastery. Learning, challenge, growth, skill development. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's research on "flow states" at the University of Chicago documented that the deepest reported satisfaction in human subjects occurred not during leisure but during periods of concentrated skill application against appropriately calibrated challenges. The mastery drive — the compulsion to get better at things — is observable across primates: young chimpanzees will practise nut-cracking for months before achieving proficiency. It is distinct from creativity, as one can master an existing skill without creating anything new, and create without any mastery whatsoever.

**The Monk.** Meaning. Purpose, values, identity, worldview. This is the category that separates Homo sapiens from every other species in the framework. The fiction-generating brain does not merely produce useful social coordinating myths — it demands them. Viktor Frankl, who survived Auschwitz and went on to found logotherapy, observed that humans can endure almost any suffering provided they can locate meaning within it — and collapse under far milder conditions if they cannot. Meaning is not a higher-order luxury that appears after material needs are met. It is a parallel requirement, running alongside every other category, and its absence is catastrophic.

**The Zookeeper.** Habitat. Shelter, finances, environment, tools, safety, stability. This is the enclosure itself — not what the animal does but what the animal needs around it. A person can have a healthy body, deep relationships, creative output, meaningful work, and a sense of purpose, and still be crushed by a mouldy flat, financial precarity, or an unsafe neighbourhood. The environment is not something the organism does; it is something the organism requires. It is a different category entirely, and its omission from most psychological wellbeing frameworks is, from a zoological perspective, **baffling**.

The test for whether these eight categories are genuinely independent is simple: can an individual flourish in seven but suffer authentically in the eighth? For every category, the answer is yes. A person with deep relationships, creative fulfilment, meaningful work, excellent health, abundant play, strong mastery, and a clear sense of purpose can still be miserable in inadequate housing. A person with everything except connection is lonely. A person with everything except meaning is lost.

Eight independent dimensions of flourishing. Each one essential. Each one measurable. And each one — as the following chapters will demonstrate — systematically undermined by the enclosure that Homo sapiens has built for itself.

I need to make a disclosure at this point, because the framework demands it. I am writing this book from inside the enclosure I am describing. I live in a suburb of Leiden with my wife and two children. My children attend a Dutch state school — a good one, by the metrics their society uses to evaluate such things — where they sit in rows for six hours a day learning material selected by a committee they will never meet. I will argue in Chapter 8 that this system fails the animal on at least four of the eight dimensions I have just described. I send them there every morning regardless, because the alternatives available to me within the current enclosure are worse. My wife works forty hours a week. I work more. We see each other in the evenings, when we are tired, and on weekends, when we are recovering from being tired. I run three times a week — on a treadmill, in shoes, in a gym with fluorescent lighting — which, as I argued several pages ago, amounts to an organism performing precisely the activity it evolved to perform, in precisely the manner that severs it from every signal its body was designed to receive. I have not solved a single one of the problems this book describes. I am the fish. The only difference between me and the reader is that I have noticed the water — and noticing has not, so far, enabled me to do anything. I cannot leave it. There is no *outside the cage*.

This is not false modesty. It is the central diagnostic challenge. The enclosure is not a conspiracy. It is not maintained by villains. It is maintained by people like me — educated, well-intentioned, aware of the problems in the abstract — who send their children into the system every morning and drive to the gym in shoes because the structure of the enclosure makes the alternative, at every individual decision point, slightly more difficult than compliance. The question is not why people do not leave. The question is why the enclosure is designed ineffectively in the first place? Leaving is not possible. We are in it. We are an organism dependent on it. There is not any escape. We are all in it together or we are dead. Suicide the only other choice. Suicide or an effectively designed environment for us all. To improve on any single dimension in an act of sustained resistance against every institution we depend on is simply not possible. We are in a cage without a door because there is no outside the cage.
---

The framework tells us what the animal needs. The question now is what the animal built — and why every system it constructed, from money to medicine, from education to justice, began as a reasonable attempt to meet one of these eight needs and ended as something its designers would not recognise.

The answer, it will turn out, is not that humans are stupid. It is that humans are operating at a scale their biology was never designed to support. And the consequences of that mismatch are in every institution, every city, and every life on the planet: 1. visible, 2. inevitable, and 3. fixable. Easily.
