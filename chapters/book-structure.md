### NARRATIVE ARC (THE EMOTIONAL SPINE)

The book follows Applebee's journey from **assignment** to **understanding**.

**Act I — Arrival & Horror** (Chapters 1–5): Applebee arrives, surveys the damage, can't believe what he's seeing. Tone: bewilderment, dark humor, mounting dread.

**Act II — Investigation** (Chapters 6–13): Applebee digs into each system, trying to understand why humans built things this way. Discovers the "decent impulse that scaled badly" pattern. Tone: forensic curiosity, punctuated by rage and tenderness.

**Act III — The Turn** (Chapters 14–17): Applebee finds things that work. Discovers humans who got it right. Begins designing the sanctuary. Tone: hope tempered by realism, growing love for the species.

**Act IV — The Blueprint** (Chapters 18–20): Applebee submits his recommendations to Mr. Reggie. The sanctuary design. What it would actually take. Tone: quiet conviction, the report becomes personal.

## ACT I — ARRIVAL & HORROR

### Chapter 1: The Brief
*"Make them happy and FLOURISHING, Applebee."*

Applebee receives his assignment from Mr. Reggie. 30 million humans. No manual. Previous coordinator quit. Mr. Reggie's only instruction: happy and flourishing. Applebee doesn't know what either word means for this species yet.

**Establishes:** The conceit. The voice. The relationship with Mr. Reggie (demanding but caring boss). Jenkins the assistant. The fundamental question: what does a human need?

**Existing material:** Opening pages of the original report. The brief, the pencil, the chair.

**Word count target:** ~4,000 words


### Chapter 2: First Impressions
*"They appear to be at war with themselves."*

Applebee's initial survey of humans in their current habitat. What he sees: creatures who built skyscrapers but can't sleep. Who mapped the genome but can't feed everyone. Who connected the entire planet with information networks and then used them to make each other miserable.

The first big observation: these animals are *extraordinary*. And they are suffering *unnecessarily*.

**Establishes:** The gap between human capability and human wellbeing. The "not broken" thesis introduced early.

**Existing material:** Original report's opening observations, the "coloured boxes" material.

**Word count target:** ~4,000 words


### Chapter 3: The Eight Things
*"Every animal needs the same things. These ones just forgot."*

Applebee develops his framework. Studies the species' own research (psychology, anthropology, neuroscience). Arrives at the eight life areas:

1. **The Vehicle** — Body (food, movement, sleep, health)
2. **The Cub** — Play & Rest (leisure, joy, purposeless presence)
3. **The Herd Member** — Connection (relationships, community, belonging)
4. **The God** — Creativity (making, expressing, building)
5. **The Slave** — Service (contributing, protecting, giving)
6. **The Master** — Mastery (learning, challenge, growth)
7. **The Monk** — Meaning (purpose, values, identity)
8. **The Zookeeper** — Habitat (shelter, finances, environment, safety)

The table. The roles. The realization that humans actually *know* what they need — their own researchers figured it out decades ago — and then built systems that systematically prevent them from getting it.

**Establishes:** The organizing spine for the rest of the book.

**Existing material:** Pages 8-9 of original report (the framework table).

**Research backing:** Maslow, Deci & Ryan (self-determination theory), Seligman (PERMA model), Dunbar.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 4: The Language Proof
*"They speak the language of wherever they grew up. They also feel the feelings of wherever they grew up. Somehow only the first one is obvious to them."*

The central philosophical argument of the book, delivered through Applebee's bewildered discovery. He runs the numbers. 1.8 billion humans. 72–97% speak the language of their environment. 100% replacement in adoption. 0% heritability.

Then the turn: if the most complex learned behavior is entirely environmental... what about everything else? Aggression. Religion. Emotional expression. Values.

The plate-smashing comparison. Greek kefi vs. Anglo property destruction. Same action, same emotion, opposite meaning. Installed by environment.

**Establishes:** The book's philosophical anchor. Environment shapes expression. Capacity is heritable, expression is environmental. This reframes everything that follows.

**Existing material:** *Geographic Birthplace as a Predictor of Primary Language* (full paper). *The Environmental Determination of Complex Behaviour* (full paper). Both already written.

**This chapter writes itself.** The papers ARE the research. Applebee's voice wraps around them.

**Word count target:** ~6,000 words


### Chapter 5: The Distillation
*"They learn like neural networks. Except nobody checks the training data."*

Applebee discovers machine learning and realizes the analogy is structural, not metaphorical. Knowledge distillation: a student network learns by approximating the soft outputs of a teacher. Not the rules — the patterns. Not "anger is correct" but "anger is likely, withdrawal is possible, calm is unlikely."

Children learn behavioral repertoires the same way. Dark knowledge: the implicit uncertainty structure. High-temperature environments produce broader behavioral variance.

The responsibility clarification: fine-tuning works precisely because the model is responsible for its current weights. Understanding origin doesn't dissolve ownership. You're responsible for what you say in English even though you didn't choose to speak it.

**Establishes:** The mechanism behind Chapter 4's observation. Moves from "what" to "how." Sets up the justice chapter.

**Existing material:** *Consensus, Distillation, and Trust* Part II (the distillation-as-learning framework). Already written.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words

## ACT II — INVESTIGATION

### Chapter 6: The Vehicle (Body)
*"They feed them poison and then sell them cures for the symptoms."*

Food systems. Industrial agriculture. Ultra-processed food. Humans evolved to move 8-12 miles daily; now sit for 10 hours. Sleep: diurnal mammals living under artificial light, checking blue screens at midnight. Healthcare: treating symptoms of environmental mismatch rather than fixing the environment.

Applebee's horror: "You know what they need. Whole food, sunlight, movement, sleep. Instead they built a $4 trillion healthcare industry to manage the consequences of not doing those things."

**Existing material:** Original report's "Vehicle" section.

**Research needed:** Michael Pollan, Matthew Walker (*Why We Sleep*), Robert Lustig (sugar/metabolic disease), Daniel Lieberman (*Exercised*).

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 7: The Cub (Play)
*"They've forgotten how to do nothing."*

Play, rest, purposeless presence. Children scheduled from 6am to 9pm. Adults who haven't played since they were 12. The commodification of leisure — even "relaxation" is now an industry (meditation apps, wellness retreats, flotation tanks).

Applebee watches children play. Notes they're extraordinary at it until about age 7, then something breaks. Discovers: school.

**Existing material:** Original report's "Cub" section.

**Research needed:** Stuart Brown (*Play*), Johann Hari (*Stolen Focus*), the overscheduling literature.

**Word count target:** ~4,000 words


### Chapter 8: The Herd Member (Connection)
*"150. That's the number. They know it. They ignore it."*

Dunbar's number. Humans evolved for bands of 150. Now live in cities of millions where they know nobody. The loneliness epidemic. Social media: the illusion of connection that prevents real connection.

The "wise aunties" passage. Humans replaced organic community conflict resolution with £300/hour lawyers. Trust used to be the default; now costs a trillion dollars a year in legal infrastructure to manage its absence.

**Existing material:** Original report's "Herd Member" section. Extensive.

**Research needed:** Robin Dunbar, Vivek Murthy (Surgeon General's loneliness advisory), Robert Putnam (*Bowling Alone*), the "Third Places" concept (Ray Oldenburg).

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 9: Shelter & Safety (The Zookeeper)
*"Some of them have 14 empty properties. Others sleep outside. In the same city."*

Housing as a commodity vs. housing as a right. The financialization of shelter. Humans who spend 40-70% of income on rent for shelter that doesn't meet basic habitat requirements (light, space, nature access, community).

Homelessness: Applebee cannot believe it. A species that builds skyscrapers *choosing* to let members sleep on the ground. The Housing First evidence — it works, it's cheaper, they know this, they don't do it.

**Existing material:** Original report's housing section. Wiki: Housing First article.

**Research needed:** Housing First evidence (Sam Tsemberis), Matthew Desmond (*Evicted*), financialization literature.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 10: Education
*"Thirteen years. They sit in rows for thirteen years. At the end they can solve quadratic equations but can't cook rice."*

The education system as industrial-era compliance training. What's taught vs. what's needed. Children learn to regurgitate information but not: how to cook, manage money, resolve conflict, process emotions, maintain their body, build relationships, find meaning, or think critically.

Applebee's question: "If environment determines expression, and you have every child for 13 years in a controlled environment... why don't you just teach them what they need?"

**Existing material:** Original report's education section.

**Research needed:** Ken Robinson, John Taylor Gatto (*Dumbing Us Down*), Finnish/Danish education models, Sudbury schools.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 11: Work & Money
*"40 hours a week. 40% say it's meaningless. They do it anyway."*

Bullshit jobs (Graeber). Work as identity. The Protestant work ethic baked into a secular society. Humans who define themselves entirely by what they're paid to do, then collapse when they retire.

Money: tokens created from nothing, lent at interest, generating artificial scarcity in a world of material abundance. Applebee traces the whole system and can't find the point where anyone agreed to it.

**Existing material:** Original report's work/money sections. *Math Foundations* paper (Bitcoin section — how trust-based currency actually works vs. fiat).

**Research needed:** David Graeber (*Bullshit Jobs*, *Debt: The First 5,000 Years*), Rutger Bregman (*Utopia for Realists*), UBI evidence.

**Word count target:** ~6,000 words


### Chapter 12: Justice
*"Revenge. They've systematized revenge and called it justice."*

The criminal justice chapter. This is where the Language Proof lands hardest. If behavior is environmentally installed, then punishment aimed at "the choice to offend" is misdirected when no such choice occurred.

Policing: $32 billion on "blue-costumed individuals paid to abuse others as an abuse reduction strategy." Prisons: warehousing damaged people in damaging environments, then being surprised when they come out more damaged. Recidivism as proof the system is producing more of what it claims to prevent.

The capacity vs. expression distinction applied to crime. The fine-tuning analogy: rehabilitation as retraining. Environments that produce different outputs from the same intensity.

**Existing material:** Original report's justice/policing sections. *Environmental Determination* paper (capacity vs. expression argument). *Consensus/Distillation* paper (fine-tuning as rehabilitation). Wiki: Justice as Prevention, Crime Prevention Research.

**This is the book's most important chapter.** All the philosophical groundwork pays off here.

**Word count target:** ~7,000 words


### Chapter 13: Trust, Media & the Coloured Boxes
*"They built a machine optimized for distress and then gave it to their children."*

Media ecology. Attention economy. An information system where the most profitable content is the most emotionally destabilizing. Applebee watches the news and can't understand why they'd design a system that makes the whole species anxious.

Trust: the thing that costs nothing but whose absence costs trillions. Social media as trust-destruction infrastructure. The irony: they connected everyone and trusted no one.

**Existing material:** Original report's media section.

**Research needed:** Johann Hari (*Stolen Focus*), Tristan Harris, Shoshana Zuboff (*Surveillance Capitalism*), Jonathan Haidt (*The Anxious Generation*).

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words

## ACT III — THE TURN

### Chapter 14: Wait — Some of Them Figured It Out?
*"Why didn't they just... copy it?"*

Applebee discovers humans who got it right. Not perfectly. But measurably, demonstrably better. This is the chapter that prevents the book from being just a critique.

Examples:
- **Portugal** — decriminalized drugs, treated addiction as health issue, outcomes improved across every metric
- **Finland** — eliminated homelessness through Housing First
- **Nordic education** — less testing, more play, better outcomes
- **Bhutan** — Gross National Happiness as a policy metric
- **Indigenous knowledge systems** — circular time, land relationship, community-embedded justice
- **Hatzalah** — community emergency response averaging under 3 minutes (vs. 7-14 for centralized dispatch)
- **Mondragon** — worker cooperatives, democratic workplaces

Applebee's frustration: "These aren't theories. These are deployed systems with measurable results. And the rest of them just... didn't adopt them."

**Existing material:** Wiki articles (Portugal Decriminalization, Housing First, etc.). *Civic Proximity Response* paper (Hatzalah evidence).

**Research needed:** Specific outcome data for each case study.

**Word count target:** ~6,000 words


### Chapter 15: Consensus Without Authority
*"The machines figured out agreement before the humans did."*

How distributed systems reach agreement without central control. Bitcoin as proof of concept: mutually distrusting nodes agreeing on a shared ledger through costly signaling. No king, no bank, no government — just math and incentives.

The three consensus mechanisms: computational (Bitcoin), behavioral (distillation/learning), social (web of trust). Same structural problem, different substrates.

Applebee's insight: humans keep trying to solve trust with hierarchy. But trust can emerge from structure, cost, and repeated interaction — whether the agents are machines, neurons, or people.

**Existing material:** *Consensus, Distillation, and Trust* (full paper). *Mathematical Foundations of Decentralized Trust* (full paper). Both already written.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 16: Death & Time
*"They hide it. They hide the one thing guaranteed to happen to every single one of them."*

How humans handle death — by pretending it won't happen. The medicalization and institutionalization of dying. The grief industry. The way fear of death causes humans to waste their living.

Circular time vs. linear time. "Anything that's ever happened is a deep part of us now." Indigenous temporalities. The idea that death isn't the opposite of life but the completion of it.

Applebee watches a human funeral and is unexpectedly moved.

**Existing material:** Original report's death section. Wiki: Circular Time.

**Research needed:** Atul Gawande (*Being Mortal*), Ernest Becker (*The Denial of Death*), Indigenous time concepts.

**Word count target:** ~4,000 words


### Chapter 17: The God and the Monk
*"They are ALL creative. Every last one of them. They just forgot."*

Creativity and meaning as biological needs, not luxuries. Humans who haven't made anything since school. Adults who say "I'm not creative" while cooking dinner, decorating their home, telling bedtime stories.

Religion and meaning-making: environmentally acquired (Chapter 4 proved this), but the need is real. Humans stripped of meaning systems become depressed, anxious, addicted. The post-religious meaning vacuum.

Applebee's tenderness: watching a human paint for the first time in 20 years.

**Existing material:** Original report's "God" and "Monk" sections. *Environmental Determination* paper (religion section).

**Research needed:** Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (*Flow*), Viktor Frankl (*Man's Search for Meaning*), the secularization-and-mental-health literature.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words

## ACT IV — THE BLUEPRINT

### Chapter 18: The Sanctuary Design
*"Right. Here's what we're going to do."*

Applebee's formal recommendations to Mr. Reggie. The sanctuary isn't a utopia — it's a minimum viable environment for human flourishing. Organized by the eight life areas.

Each recommendation is practical, evidence-based, and designed to be *cheaper* than what humans currently do. Because every single time, the humane thing is also the economical thing. Housing First is cheaper than homelessness management. Prevention is cheaper than incarceration. Whole food is cheaper than metabolic disease.

**Establishes:** The constructive vision. Applebee isn't just a critic — he's an engineer.

**Existing material:** Original report's recommendations section.

**Word count target:** ~6,000 words


### Chapter 19: The Ring
*"What if they could just... call for help? And someone would come?"*

The NFC ring. The civic proximity response system. Not as tech pitch — as Applebee's solution to the most basic problem: humans in trouble can't summon help fast enough.

The structural latency problem. The bystander effect and how to counteract it. The mesh network. The density math. The fact that all of this is buildable *right now* with existing technology.

But really this chapter is about the deeper thing: what if the infrastructure of trust was physical? What if you wore it on your finger? What if knowing that help would come changed how an entire community felt?

**Existing material:** *Civic Proximity Response* paper (full paper, already written). Ring SOS protocol spec.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 20: The Vouchers
*"Three people who physically met you. That's it. That's the whole identity system."*

OMXUS. Proof of Humanity. Three vouches. No government, no corporation, no database to hack, no authority to corrupt.

Applebee designs the identity system and the governance model. Proportional influence. Quadratic voting. Direct democracy. The web of trust as the foundation for everything else — because you can't distribute resources fairly, count votes honestly, or respond to emergencies effectively without first knowing who's real.

The social cost of fraud: "Try explaining why you refuse to vouch for someone you know."

**Existing material:** *Mathematical Foundations of Decentralized Trust* (full paper). OMXUS website and wiki. The whitepaper.

**Word count target:** ~5,000 words


### Chapter 21: The Report
*"They are not broken, Mr. Reggie."*

Applebee submits his report. The conclusion of the original manuscript, expanded. The compassion note: every destructive system started as a decent impulse that scaled badly.

"Do whatever you want" as the only ethical system that works universally — your freedom ends where another's begins.

The final field note. Applebee watching the humans from outside the enclosure. Realizing he's become fond of them. The pencil is worn down. The chair still stinks.

Quiet ending. No grand declarations. Just: here's what I found, here's what I recommend, they're not broken, and I think they can do it.

**Existing material:** Original report's conclusion.

**Word count target:** ~3,000 words

## TOTAL STRUCTURE

| Section | Chapters | Est. Words |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Act I — Arrival & Horror | Ch 1–5 | ~24,000 |
| Act II — Investigation | Ch 6–13 | ~43,000 |
| Act III — The Turn | Ch 14–17 | ~20,000 |
| Act IV — The Blueprint | Ch 18–21 | ~19,000 |
| Front/Back Matter | — | ~4,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **21 chapters** | **~110,000** |

Standard trade nonfiction is 70,000–90,000 words. At 110,000 this is on the long side (like Sapiens at ~115,000). Could trim to 85,000 by combining some investigation chapters (e.g., merge Play into Body, merge Media into Connection). But the voice is fast and funny — long chapters won't feel long.

## WHAT'S ALREADY WRITTEN VS. WHAT NEEDS WRITING

### Already exists (needs Applebee voice wrapped around it):
- Chapter 4 (Language Proof) — full paper exists
- Chapter 5 (Distillation) — full paper exists
- Chapter 12 (Justice) — between the report + 2 papers, 80% is there
- Chapter 15 (Consensus) — full papers exist
- Chapter 19 (Ring/Emergency) — full paper exists
- Chapter 20 (Vouchers/OMXUS) — paper + wiki + whitepaper exist
- Chapters 1, 2, 3 (Setup) — original report has strong drafts
- Chapter 21 (Conclusion) — original report's ending

### Needs significant new writing:
- Chapter 6 (Body/Food) — research needed
- Chapter 7 (Play) — research needed
- Chapter 8 (Connection) — partially exists, needs expansion
- Chapter 9 (Housing) — partially exists, needs data
- Chapter 10 (Education) — partially exists, needs examples
- Chapter 11 (Work/Money) — partially exists, needs Graeber-level depth
- Chapter 13 (Media/Trust) — partially exists, needs updating
- Chapter 14 (What Works) — needs case study research
- Chapter 16 (Death) — partially exists, needs expansion
- Chapter 17 (Creativity/Meaning) — partially exists, needs research

### Rough estimate: ~50-60% of the book's intellectual content already exists across the report, papers, and wiki. The remaining work is research for the "Investigation" chapters and wrapping everything in Applebee's voice.

## VOICE NOTES

Applebee's voice is the product. Some rules to preserve it:

1. **Never break character.** Applebee is always writing field notes. He doesn't know he's writing a book.
2. **The research appears as things Applebee discovers.** "I found a study by some humans called Bouchard et al..." not "Research shows..."
3. **Pencil marginalia.** Side notes, crossed-out words, Applebee arguing with himself.
4. **Jenkins and Chatty stay.** The assistant and the chatty colleague provide dialogue breaks and comic relief.
5. **Mr. Reggie stays off-page.** Referenced but never directly present. The authority figure whose approval Applebee seeks.
6. **Applebee falls in love with the species.** Gradually, reluctantly, completely. By the end he doesn't want to leave the enclosure.
7. **The humor serves the argument.** Every joke is also an observation. Every observation could be a joke.
8. **Data appears in Applebee's handwriting.** Tables, numbers, statistics — presented as his own calculations, with occasional arithmetic errors crossed out.

---

## THE PUBLISHING QUESTION

This is either:
- **A) Self-published through OMXUS** with the papers as free companion material and the wiki as the community hub. Maximum control, direct relationship with readers, the book IS the front door to the project.
- **B) Traditionally published** for reach, credibility, bookshop presence, translation rights, and the machinery of literary culture. Requires an agent, a proposal, and willingness to let someone else's name go on the spine as publisher.
- **C) Hybrid** — self-publish first, build audience, then sell to a publisher with a proven readership. This is increasingly common and gives you leverage.

The content supports any of these. The question is what you want the book to *do* — sell copies or start a movement. (The answer might be both.)
