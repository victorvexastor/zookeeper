ANNOUNCER: You're listening to "Don't Be a C***" — the podcast where unlikely pairs discuss the issues that matter. This week: Iron Mike Tyson and Mahatma Gandhi break down the token system. Let's get into it.

[Music fades]

MIKE: Yo, what's up everybody, welcome back to Don't Be a C***. I'm Mike Tython, and I'm here with my guy, my brother, the OG of non-violenth, Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, how you feelin' today, brother?

GANDHI: I am well, Michael. I have had my morning walk, my prayers, and a simple meal of goat's milk. I am ready to discuss this token system.

MIKE: Thath beautiful, man. Thath really beautiful. I had a protein thake and I fed my pigeonth. You know I love my pigeonth, right?

GANDHI: Yes, Michael. You have mentioned the pigeons. Many times.

MIKE: They're pure, man. They don't lie. They don't cheat. They jutht... they jutht are. You know what I mean?

GANDHI: I do. There is much wisdom in observing creatures who live simply.

MIKE: Eggthactly. Eggthactly. Anyway, we're here to talk about thith token thing. You been reading about it?

GANDHI: I have. And I must say, Michael — I find it most interesting.

MIKE: Okay, tho, break it down for the people. What ith it?

GANDHI: It is quite simple, really. One token for each human being. Not one token for the wealthy, many for the poor. Equal. One each.

MIKE: One each. I like that. When I wath coming up, we didn't have one each of nothing. We had nothing each of everything. You feel me?

GANDHI: I do feel you, Michael. I too grew up in a world of profound inequality. The British took much from my people. They did not give us "one each."

MIKE: The Britith. Man. They colonithed everybody.

GANDHI: Indeed. They were, as you might say on this podcast—

MIKE: They were being c***th.

GANDHI: [sighs] Yes. That is the terminology we have agreed to use.

MIKE: Don't be a c***, Britith Empire. Too late though. They were definitely c***th.

GANDHI: The past cannot be changed. But the future — the future is what we discuss today.

MIKE: Okay tho tell me about thith thafety button thing. Becauth I like that part.

GANDHI: When a person is in danger, they press a button. And within sixty seconds, their community arrives.

MIKE: Thixty theconds. That'th one round.

GANDHI: I'm sorry?

MIKE: In boxing. Thixty theconds. That'th how long you got between roundth to recover. To get your head right. Thixty theconds can change everything.

GANDHI: That is... actually quite profound, Michael.

MIKE: I've been knocked out. I've been the one doing the knocking out. And I'm telling you — thixty theconds? That'th enough time. If people show up in thixty theconds, that'th a game changer.

GANDHI: Currently, police take twenty minutes or more. And when they arrive, they often bring more violence.

MIKE: I've theen that. I grew up in Brownthville. Cops weren't there to protect uth. They were there to... you know.

GANDHI: To control. Yes. I experienced the same with the British police in India. They did not serve us. They served the Empire.

MIKE: Tho thith token thing — the community showth up inthtead?

GANDHI: Yes. Your neighbours. People who know you. People who have vouched for you.

MIKE: That'th the tribe, man. That'th the tribe coming to protect you.

---

GANDHI: Michael, may I share something?

MIKE: Go ahead, G.

GANDHI: In my philosophy of non-violence — Ahimsa — the goal is not merely the absence of violence. It is the presence of love. Active love. Love that shows up.

MIKE: Mmm.

GANDHI: This system — with the sixty-second response — it is Ahimsa made practical. It is love that arrives. Not police with weapons. Neighbours with presence.

MIKE: That'th deep, G. That'th really deep.

GANDHI: Most violence occurs because people believe no one is watching. No one will come. They are isolated with their victim. But if twelve people arrive in sixty seconds—

MIKE: The violenth thtops. Becauth he'th outnumbered.

GANDHI: And because he is seen. Witnessed. Accountability is present.

MIKE: You know what thith remindth me of?

GANDHI: What, Michael?

MIKE: When I bit Holyfield'th ear off.

GANDHI: [long pause] I... did not expect this reference.

MIKE: No, lithten. In that moment, I lotht my mind. I wath angry. I wath out of control. And everybody thaw it. Millionth of people. And I had to deal with that. I had to anther for it.

GANDHI: You are saying that being witnessed created accountability.

MIKE: Eggthactly. If nobody thaw it, maybe I don't change. Maybe I keep being that guy. But everybody thaw. And I had to look at mythelf.

GANDHI: The token system creates that witnessing at the community level.

MIKE: Right. You can't be a c*** when everybody'th watching. Well, you can. But you gonna get called out.

GANDHI: The name of this podcast becomes relevant.

MIKE: Alwayth. Don't be a c***. That'th the whole philothophy right there.

GANDHI: Let us discuss the voting mechanism.

MIKE: Yeah, what'th that about? Prox... proxthimi...

GANDHI: Proximity-weighted voting.

MIKE: Yeah, that thing.

GANDHI: It means your vote counts more on issues that directly affect you. If you live on a street, you have more say about that street than someone who has never been there.

MIKE: That maketh thenth. Like, why should thome politician in Washington or wherever decide what happeneth in my neighbourhood?

GANDHI: Exactly. Under British rule, decisions about India were made in London. By men who had never seen our villages. Never eaten our food. Never felt our sun.

MIKE: And they made bad dethithions.

GANDHI: Catastrophic decisions. Millions died in famines while grain was exported to England.

MIKE: That'th c*** behaviour, G.

GANDHI: Yes, Michael. That is c*** behaviour. The token system prevents this. The people closest to the problem have the loudest voice.

MIKE: Tho if I live next to, like, a factory that'th polluting — my vote on that ith bigger than thome guy on the other thide of the country?

GANDHI: Precisely.

MIKE: Yo, that'th fair though. That'th actually fair.

---

MIKE: Okay but here'th my quethtion.

GANDHI: Yes?

MIKE: What about the c***th? Like, there'th alwayth gonna be c***th. What do you do with the c***th?

GANDHI: This is the eternal question, Michael. What does society do with those who cause harm?

MIKE: Becauth right now we lock them up. And that don't work. I been locked up. It don't make you better. It maketh you worthe.

GANDHI: I too have been imprisoned. By the British. Many times.

MIKE: No thit?

GANDHI: Many, many times. And I observed — prison does not rehabilitate. It humiliates. It brutalizes. It creates more damage.

MIKE: Tho what'th the anther?

GANDHI: The token system proposes community accountability. You face the people you harmed. You hear them. They hear you. Together, you determine what repair looks like.

MIKE: Like a... like a truth thing?

GANDHI: Restorative justice. Yes. In South Africa, after apartheid, they had Truth and Reconciliation. People confessed. Victims were heard. Not everyone was satisfied. But healing began.

MIKE: That'th heavy.

GANDHI: Prisons do not heal. They simply relocate the wound.

MIKE: [long pause] I with thomeone had done that with me. When I wath young. Inthtead of jutht locking me up, making me more angry, more violent... what if thomeone had jutht... theen me? Made me fathe what I did? Made me underthtand?

GANDHI: You might have found peace sooner.

MIKE: Maybe. Maybe.

---

GANDHI: There is an image associated with this system. From a children's film.

MIKE: The anth and the grathopperth?

GANDHI: Yes. You know it?

MIKE: A Bug'th Life. I love that movie, man. I watth it with my kidth.

GANDHI: The grasshoppers exploit the ants. Take their food. Rule through fear.

MIKE: But there'th way more anth.

GANDHI: Yes. And the moment the ants realise this—

MIKE: It'th over. Boom. Done. Grathopperth are finithed.

GANDHI: This is what the token system enables. It allows the many to see each other. To coordinate.

MIKE: It'th like... we've alwayth had the power. We jutht didn't know how to uthe it together.

GANDHI: Exactly, Michael. The British could not have ruled India without Indian cooperation. The moment we withdrew that cooperation — salt march, non-compliance, simply refusing — their power collapsed.

MIKE: You jutht thopped lithening to them?

GANDHI: We stopped participating in our own oppression.

MIKE: [whistles] That'th cold, G. That'th real cold.

GANDHI: It is simply mathematics. They are few. We are many. They require our compliance. We do not require theirs.

MIKE: Don't be a c***, he thaid, and then ended an empire.

GANDHI: [small laugh] I would not put it quite that way.

MIKE: I would. That'th eggthactly how I'd put it.

---

MIKE: Okay tho here'th what I'm hearing.

GANDHI: Yes?

MIKE: Thith token thing — it'th about rethpect.

GANDHI: Say more.

MIKE: Like, everyone geth one. Equal. That'th rethpect. You vote on thit that affecth you. That'th rethpect. Your neighbourth show up when you're in trouble. That'th rethpect. You fathe the people you've hurt. That'th rethpect.

GANDHI: I had not framed it that way, but yes.

MIKE: The whole thythtem ith jutht... rethpect. Treated like a human being. Not a number. Not a conthumer. Not a criminal. A human.

GANDHI: You have captured the essence, Michael.

MIKE: I told you, G. I ain't jutht a pretty fathe.

GANDHI: No one has ever accused you of that, Michael.

MIKE: ...Wath that a joke?

GANDHI: [smiling] Perhaps.

MIKE: Gandhi made a joke! Yo, everybody, Gandhi'th got joketh!

---

GANDHI: May I offer a closing thought?

MIKE: Go ahead, king.

GANDHI: Throughout my life, I struggled with one question: How do we build a society where the strong do not crush the weak?

MIKE: I been the thtrong. I've been the cruthher. I know that thide.

GANDHI: And I have been crushed. I know that side.

MIKE: Tho how do we fitth it?

GANDHI: We remove the distance. We remove the anonymity. We remove the machinery that allows harm without consequence.

MIKE: Like, if I have to look you in the eye—

GANDHI: — it is harder to harm you.

MIKE: If my neighbourth are watching—

GANDHI: — it is harder to be cruel.

MIKE: If I have to fathe you after I hurt you—

GANDHI: — I must confront what I have done.

MIKE: That'th the whole thing right there.

GANDHI: The token system does not assume humans are angels. It assumes we are human. Capable of great good and great harm. And it builds structures that encourage the good and discourage the harm.

MIKE: Don't be a c***.

GANDHI: [sighs] Must we keep using—

MIKE: It'th the name of the podcatht, G.

GANDHI: Very well. Don't be a c***. And the system makes it harder to be one.

---

MIKE: Aight, we gotta wrap thith up. Any final wordth?

GANDHI: Be the change you wish to see in the world. Get your token. Vouch for your neighbours. Show up in sixty seconds. Vote on what affects you.

MIKE: That wath beautiful. Real beautiful.

GANDHI: And you, Michael?

MIKE: [pause] Everybody'th got a plan till they get punched in the mouth.

GANDHI: ...How does that relate to—

MIKE: The thythtem we got now? It'th been punching uth in the mouth our whole liveth. Time to punch back. But like... non-violently. With tokenths.

GANDHI: That is... an interesting synthesis of our philosophies.

MIKE: We make a good team, G.

GANDHI: We do, Michael. Against all expectations, we do.

MIKE: Aight, that'th the thow! Thankth for lithening to Don't Be a C***. I'm Mike Tython.

GANDHI: And I am Mahatma Gandhi.

MIKE: Get your tokenths. Show up for your neighbourth. And don't be a c***.

GANDHI: Peace be upon you all.

MIKE: Peaeth.
