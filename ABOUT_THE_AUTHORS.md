## The Zookeeper (by Giles Ross)

**Giles Ross** is a British biologist with a PhD in soil mites (Acari) from Antarctic fieldwork, and early career at Western Sydney University's Hawkesbury campus (Richmond, NSW). He now lives in Leiden, the Netherlands, with his wife and two sons. He and Tia met in Australia, working a job they both quit after a couple of weeks. You can read about him and his work; he is real, and the stories in this book are real.

Giles took Tia to work for a day so she could be a koala scientist and see what's up. The revelation in the penguin house at Rotterdam Zoo happened. The sandwich at the Hawkesbury food court happened. The lens turns back: he sends his children to the school he criticises. He runs on a treadmill. He is in the enclosure too.

## Applebee's Report (voice: Applebee)

**Applebee** is a fictional narrator — Senior Enclosure Coordinator assigned to the Human Sanctuary Project. His voice is a blend of Giles and Tia: the zoologist's precision and the advocate's rage, the outsider's bewilderment and the insider's recognition. Jenkins (his assistant) and Mr. Reggie (his boss) are part of the conceit. The report format — field notes, pencil marginalia — is the frame.

The *content* is real. The systems described are real. Many of the stories (the monkey bars, the stairs, the gorilla who gets a better habitat than the zookeeper) are drawn from lived experience.

## Tia

Tia is a criminologist and counsellor. Prior to an accident that led to FND (Functional Neurological Disorder), CPTSD, and made her autism harder to manage, she worked in criminal justice and mental health. She has been an advocate against injustice since childhood.

At age six, her teacher asked the class to write down a wish. One child wished differently from the others. Tia didn't wish for a bike or a birthday party. She wished for everyone who was hungry to have food. She had simply taken the instruction literally: they could wish for anything.

At age eight, she convinced her class to debate the proposition that "people who kill people to show killing is wrong is a dumb idea."

She has worked with the Department of Justice and Informa International. Since being arrested and seeing the system from the inside — she is currently on bail for a crime she did not commit — she has been deeply traumatised by it and committed to changing it. She believes she was targeted because of the ideas in this book. She hopes to create a world where what has happened to her does not happen to anyone else ever again.
