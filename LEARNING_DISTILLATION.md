# Learning Distillation

My mother never verbalised those things. She took me to galleries constantly as a child and looked at one painting for twenty minutes. She didn't explain. She just stood there.

As a grown up I looked into it and tested it and found anybody could enjoy a gallery with the technique: simply process the piece and say whatever you think, because that's the point of art. It evokes something.

She gave me the technique by doing it — not by explaining it. I stood next to her and absorbed the practice of *looking*.

That's the process:
1. Learn by osmosis (stand next to someone who sees)
2. Decode what they did silently
3. Test it on others
4. Confirm it works universally

Gallery technique → design principles → systems thinking → "people aren't broken, fix the system."

She taught me systems thinking in front of a painting without saying a word.
